Butterfly Magic
It looks like this butterfly is hanging upside-down on a blossom that is suspended mid air.  What you can't see is the single line of spider web by which the blossom is hanging.  I had no idea the photo would be like this until I saw it on my computer.  What are the odds.  The butterfly is a female gray hairstreak, you can tell by the fact that her abdomen is all gray with no orange.  She is tiny and apparently does not weight enough to knock the blossom off the thread of silk.  No photoshop or rotation here, just incredible luck on my part.

True on any given spring or summer day you can find these guys all around. However this one was spotted when I was volunteering at the Southwest Courthouse in Hulen. These guys are gray as their name suggests. They also have a bit of orange on the bottoms of their wings. They are super small and very fragile. They normally sit without flapping their wings. They sit more like a Wood Nymph when feeding. These guys also have a habit of moving their lower wings together for some reason. They are one of my favorites and one of the easiest to ID. They are unmistakable. They are very common and can be seen in backyards, gardens, plant shops, and pollinator gardens. Anywhere their favorite plants can be found. These were one of the insects on the FFA ID contest list back when I was in high school.

7 September 2015: The long dry spell finally broke in the North Texas area and early today on the morning of September 9, 2015, we got some rain that made the grass look a little greener and the two-weeks long dry rock bed of Cooper Creek filled up with the precious liquid once again. But we were fortunate in that two days earlier we were visited by a Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus) that nectared on one of the cacti’s little red flowers outside and stayed for quite a long time past sunset. This was the first time that we documented Gray Hairstreak in the Avondale Park and Cooper Creek habitat that comprises it. A welcomed visitor, this observation presents three different digital images that were taken of this butterfly. The last previous rainfall we’d had in this area of the North Texas metropolitan area was around June 15, 2015, nearly three months ago. The forecast for this weekend’s weather has the temperature gauge falling to the mid- and high-eighties. It looks like there’s a change coming and the trees are beginning to dress the part. Avondale Park and Cooper Creek are administered by the City of Denton, Texas.","Avondale Park, Denton, Texas",33.242657,-97.109358,"Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus), Avondale Park, Denton, Texas, Cooper Creek, butterflies, hairstreaks, summer, rainfall, City of Denton, North Texas","Gray Hairstreak","http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/1932204","https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/2363923/medium.jpg?1441862521","aguilita",1932204,"Gray Hairstreak","Insecta",50931,"false",3,0,"2015-09-07","2015-09-07","","Central Time (US & Canada)",307,"","","false",NA,"",NA,115129,"2015-09-10 05:21:57 UTC","2017-05-07 22:09:18 UTC","research","CC-BY-NC",NA,"false"

Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus)

7 August 2015: Observed a Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus) at the Lake Lewisville Environmental Learning Area (LLELA) in Lewisville, Texas. LLELA is administered jointly by the US Army Corps of Engineers, City of Lewisville, Texas, and the University of North Texas.  

The Gray Hairstreak butterfly ranges over North America. Its flies literally over the entire continental United States except for the farthest northern edges of the state of Maine in New England. And it also flies over more than half of Mexico from its northern states to its southcentral states. Only Mexico’s most southern and southeastern states are outside the range of the Gray Hairstreak. And Canada is visited by the Gray Hairstreak in three of its mid-central provinces in their southern areas adjoining the US states of Montana and North Dakota. These provinces include Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. It is in fact one of the most widely distributed North American butterflies. The range of the Gray Hairstreak does not extend to the Caribbean or past the central states of Mexico into Central and South America.

Because of its inimitable presence in North America, in Mexico, United States, and Canada, the Gray Hairstreak is without question a genuine resident of the Western Hemisphere.

Going for a morning hike along the Kaibob Trail as it passes through the Saddle Mountain Wilderness along the east Rim of the Grand Canyon, there was a field of these yellow Asteraceae and a greater diversity of butterflies than I had ever seen in my life. There were at least a dozen species and hundreds of individuals. The birding trip quickly morphed into a butterfly photography trip. I tried to photograph all of the species I saw, but several including at least one large fritillary and a swallowtail eluded me.
